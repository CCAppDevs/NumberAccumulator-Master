// Edit the following code to have the following behavior:
    // When the input has a number and the add button is pressed the function fires and should do the following:
        // Adds the number to the running total 
            // if this doesnt behave the way you expect then try looking up how to convert a string to a number, inputs are treated as strings by default
        // Updates the h3 element (id="display") to the following "Total: <the value of total>";
        // Clears the input so the user can add a new value.
